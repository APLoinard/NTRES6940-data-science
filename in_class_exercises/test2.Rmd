## GitHub brief intro & config

Before we wrap up for today, we are going to set up Git and GitHub which we will be using along with R and RStudio for the rest of the course. 

Before we do the setup configuration, let us take a moment to talk about what Git and GitHub are. 

It can help to think of GitHub like Dropbox: you identify folders for GitHub to 'track' and it syncs them to the cloud. This is good first-and-foremost because it makes a back-up copy of your files: if your computer dies not all of your work is gone. But with GitHub, you have to be more deliberate about when syncs are made. This is because GitHub saves these as different versions, with information about who contributed when, line-by-line. This makes collaboration easier, and it allows you to roll-back to different versions or contribute to others' work.

git will track and version your files, GitHub stores this online and enables you to collaborate with others (and yourself). Although git and GitHub are two different things, distinct from each other, we can think of them as a bundle since we will always use them together. 

### Configure GitHub

This set up is a one-time thing! You will only have to do this once per computer. We'll walk through this together. In a browser, go to github.com and to your profile page as a reminder.   

**You will need to remember your GitHub username, the email address you created your GitHub account with, and your GitHub password.** 
  
  #### Installing packages
  
  We will be using the `use_git_config()` function from the `usethis` package. We first need to install this package. Type the following in a new script:
  
  ```{r install-usethis, eval=FALSE}
## setup packages
install.packages("usethis")
```

Once you have run it, "comment it out" by adding a hash tag (#) at the beginning of the line. It is generally considered good practice to not include active install.packages() prompts in a script so that someone else running your script on their system won't automatically install packages unknowingly. 
  
  Now we've installed the package, but we need to tell R that we are going to use the functions within the `usethis` package. We do this by using the function `library()`.

In my mind, this is analogous to needing to wire your house for electricity: this is something you do once; this is `install.packages`. But then you need to turn on the lights each time you need them (R Session).

It's a nice convention to do this on the same line as your commented-out `install.packages()` line; this makes it easier for someone (including you in a future time or computer) to install the package easily. 
  
  ```{r install-usethis3}
  ## setup packages
  library(usethis) # install.packages("usethis")
  ```
  
  When `usethis` is successfully attached, you won't get any feedback in the Console. So unless you get an error, this worked for you.


#### Setting up git on your system

Then type the following into your Console: 

```{r usethis, eval=FALSE}
## use_git_config function with my username and email as arguments
use_git_config(user.name = "jules32", user.email = "jules32@example.org")
```

If you see `Error in use_git_config() : could not find function "use_git_config"` please run `library("usethis")`

### Ensure that Git/GitHub/RStudio are communicating

We are going to go through a few steps to ensure the Git/GitHub are communicating with RStudio

#### RStudio: New Project

Click on New Project. There are a few different ways; you could also go to File > New Project..., or click the little green + with the R box in the top left.
also in the File menu).

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/new_project1.png")  
```

<br>


#### Select Version Control

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/new_project2.png")  
```

<br>

#### Select Git

Since we are using git. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/new_project3.png")  
```

<br>

Do you see what I see? 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/new_project4b.png")  
```

<br>

If yes, hooray! Time to wrap up for today! You're now ready for exploring integrated GitHub/RStudio workflows next week.
  
  If no, we will help you troubleshoot.
  
  1. Double check that GitHub username and email are correct
  1. Troubleshooting, starting with [HappyGitWithR's troubleshooting chapter](http://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html)
  - `which git` (Mac, Linux, or anything running a bash shell)
  - `where git` (Windows, when not in a bash shell)
1. Potentially set up a RStudio Cloud account: <https://rstudio.cloud/>

### Troubleshooting

#### Configure git from Terminal

If `usethis` fails, the following is the classic approach to configuring **git**.  Open the Git Bash program (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) and type the following:

        # display your version of git
        git --version
        
        # replace USER with your Github user account
        git config --global user.name USER
        
        # replace NAME@EMAIL.EDU with the email you used to register with Github
        git config --global user.email NAME@EMAIL.EDU
        
        # list your config to confirm user.* variables set
        git config --list

This will configure git with global (`--global`) commands, which means it will apply 'globally' to all your future github repositories, rather than only to this one now. **Note for PCs**: We've seen PC failures correct themselves by doing the above but omitting `--global`. (Then you will need to configure GitHub for every repo you clone but that is fine for now).
                                     
                                     #### Troubleshooting
                                     
                                     All troubleshooting starts with reading Happy Git With R's [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](http://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) troubleshooting chapter. 

##### New(ish) Error on a Mac
We've also seen the following errors from RStudio: 
                                       
                                       ```
                                     error key does not contain a section --global terminal
                                     ```
                                     and
                                     ```
                                     fatal: not in a git directory
                                     ```
                                     
                                     To solve this, go to the Terminal and type:
                                       ```
                                     which git
                                     ```
                                     
                                     <img src="img/git_whichgit.png" width="250px">
                                       
                                       
                                       Look at the filepath that is returned. Does it say anything to do with Apple?
                                       
                                       -> If yes, then the [Git you downloaded](https://git-scm.com/downloads) isn't installed, please redownload if necessary, and follow instructions to install.  

-> If no, (in the example image, the filepath does not say anything with Apple) then proceed below:

In RStudio, navigate to: Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN.

<br>

Does the **“Git executable”** filepath match what the url in Terminal says? 

<br>

If not, click the browse button and navigate there.   

>*Note*: on my laptop, even though I navigated to /usr/local/bin/git, it then automatically redirect because /usr/local/bin/git was an alias on my computer. That is fine. Click OK.

### END **RMarkdown/GitHub** session!
