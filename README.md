### Course description

As datasets grow larger and more complex across all areas of science, computational skills are increasingly in high demand. This course introduces a series of practical tools that enable researchers to spend less time wrestling with software or repeating error-prone manual data processing and more time getting research done in efficient and transparent ways that facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. We will work in R/RStudio, primarily with the tidyverse packages and with Git and Github integration. Topics covered include 1) formatting, filtering, exploration and visualization of complex datasets (data wrangling), 2) basic programming for building and automating custom tools, 3) tracking the history of file changes (version control) with Git and GitHub, 4) strategies for effective collaboration on data processing pipelines, and 5) using R Markdown to combine text, equations, code, tables, and figures into reports, websites, and presentations. The course emphasizes practical skill development and will be structured around hands-on (the keyboard) learning.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Describe strategies for ensuring that their data analysis is reproducible
* Demonstrate best practices for coding and project-oriented workflows in RStudio
* Import and clean messy data files using a variety of packages and functions in R 
* Subset, reorganize, and merge diverse datasets in R
* Effectively explore and visualize patterns in complex datasets with ggplot in R
* Write simple functions/programs and data analysis pipelines in R
* Automate repeated analysis tasks in R
* Use R Markdown to combine text, equations, code, tables, and figures into reports, websites, and presentations
* Track the history of file changes (version control) and collaborate effectively on scripts with others with Git and GitHub

### Prerequisites

Prior experience with R will be advantageous, but is not essential. We will try to make the material accessible to people from a diversity of backgrounds. If you have never worked in R before, we recommend working through the following tutorials prior to the course:
