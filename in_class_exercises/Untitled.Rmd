## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
getwd()
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```

The total number of cars is `r sum(cars)`  
The max speed in this dataset is `r max(cars$speed)`  
Now I want something <span style="color: red;">red</span>
Details about the dataset can be found here (https://www.rpubs.com/dksmith01/cars)

```{r}

```




```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
