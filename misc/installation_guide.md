Pre-course installation guide
================

Please follow this guide and install the following programs on your laptop before our first lecture.

R and RStudio
-------------

Please follow the instructions in [section 1.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) of the R for Data Science book.

**Note**: which R version?

R packages
----------

Please install the R packages that we are going to use in this class. Install by copying the following code to RStudio console one line at a time and hit "Enter" to run.

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```

Slack
-----

Please install [Slack](https://slack.com/download) on your laptop, and then [join the work space for our class](https://join.slack.com/t/ntres-6940/shared_invite/enQtOTYzMzc5NjMwNTgwLWJjNWIzOWUxOGE0YjliNjVlMDk2YjM4MDAwNzJkMzY2NDlmOTJmNjBjMjQwMTQwZTk5ZDA5N2EwNjE4Mzc4ZTE). We will use Slack as our primary tool for communication in this class. More importantly, we want to use our Slack workspace as a communication platform for the R user community in Cornell, where people can find help and/or collaboration oppotunities.

That being said, if you do not plan to use Slack regularly, please go to "Preferences" on Slack and check the box that says "Send me email notifications for mentions and direct messages". That way, you will able to receive all of our anouncements without needing to log in on Slack all the time.

GitHub account
--------------

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, please [create one](https://github.com/join).

**Note**: we might need to import the roster to GitHub classroom first.

GitHub Desktop (optional)
-------------------------

You can optionally download the [GitHub Desktop program](https://desktop.github.com/). RStudio has some of the same functionalities as GitHub Desktop, and it is a matter of personal preference when choosing which program to use.
